I have reason to believe that the bad actors that caused multiple hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of losses were the player Mylie Schmidt
and the Dealer Billy Jones. Mylie Schmidt has been observed winning large sums of money whenever Billy Jones is dealing on the roulette table.     
There have been 13 instances of this occurrence happening, 5 instances on March 10th, 5 instances on March 12th, and 3 instances on March 15th. I
recommend the immediate dismissal of Billy Jones, the forming of a court case against both Billy Jones and Mylie Schmidt, and that both of them 
are permanently banned from entering Lucky Duck Casinos.
